## Sources

### Reminders

* In this course, getting help from online sources is okay as long as you cite them and indicate which lines of code you copied.
* In this course, getting help from other people is okay as long as you are not copy/pasting their code and you are doing all the typing.
* In this course, it is considered cheating if you copy code from your peers or get someone to do all the work for you.
* Each project file has a file history that can be used to easily determine excessive copy/pasting.
* Lying about your sources (e.g. saying you didn't get help when you actually did) can lead to disciplinary actions.

### Answer the questions below before submitting this task.

1. Did you use any online sources aside from the assigned videos and notes? (Yes/No)

→ Yes.

1a. If you answered 'Yes' to Question 1, put the links to any online sources you used.

→ https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/bezier 
https://p5js.org/learn/curves.html 
https://developer.mozilla.org/enUS/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/unshift

1b. If you answered 'Yes' to Question 1, indicate which lines of code you copy/pasted.

→ I learned about how to use bezier curves. I learned about more advanced array methods.

2. Did you have any help from anyone aside from the teacher? (Yes/No)

→ Yes.

2a. If you answered 'Yes' to Question 2, indicate who helped you (e.g. a classmate, a relative, a tutor, etc.).

→ My dad, Rehan.

2b. If you answered 'Yes' to Question 2, indicate how each person helped you. 

→ My dad helped me clean up some of my code and write it in a clearer more concise way. He also explained and showed me how to properly use the ball function to make randomly moving control points for the beziers. He thoroughly walked me through how to make the trails. I was having a lot of issues understanding how they work.
Rehan saw where I wrote circle instead of ball which was causing nothing to work.
